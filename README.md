# Versionize

> stop using weird build scripts to increment your nuget's version, use `versionize`!

Automatic versioning and CHANGELOG generation, using [conventional commit messages](https://conventionalcommits.org).

_how it works:_

1. when you land commits on your `main` branch, select the _Squash and Merge_ option (not required).
2. add a title and body that follows the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://conventionalcommits.org).
3. when you're ready to release a nuget package:
    1. `git checkout main; git pull origin main`
    2. run `versionize`
    3. `git push --follow-tags origin main`
    4. `dotnet pack`
    5. `dotnet nuget push`

`versionize` does the following:

1. bumps the version in your `.csproj` file (based on your commit history)
2. uses [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to update _CHANGELOG.md_
3. commits `.csproj` file and _CHANGELOG.md_
4. tags a new release

## Installation

```bash
dotnet tool install --global Versionize
```

## Usage

```bash
Usage: versionize [command] [options]

Options:
  -?|-h|--help                         Show help information.
  -v|--version                         Show version information.
  -w|--workingDir <WORKING_DIRECTORY>  Directory containing projects to version
  --configDir <CONFIG_DIRECTORY>       Directory containing the .versionize configuration file
  -d|--dry-run                         Skip changing versions in projects, changelog generation and git commit
  --skip-dirty                         Skip git dirty check
  -r|--release-as <VERSION>            Specify the release version manually
  --silent                             Suppress output to console
  --skip-commit                        Don't commit changes to the git repository
  --skip-tag                           Don't tag the release commit
  --skip-changelog                     Don't update the changelog
  -i|--ignore-insignificant-commits    Don't bump the version if no significant commits (fix, feat or BREAKING)
                                       are found
  --exit-insignificant-commits         Exits with a non zero exit code if no significant commits (fix, feat or
                                       BREAKING) are found
  --commit-suffix                      Suffix to be added to the end of the release commit message (e.g. [skip ci])
  -p|--pre-release                     Release as pre-release version with given pre release label.
  -a|--aggregate-pre-releases          Include all pre-release commits in the changelog since the last full version.
                                       Only applies when new version is stable (non pre-release).
  --find-release-commit-via-message    Use commit message instead of tag to find last release commit.
  --tag-only                           Don't read/write the version from/to project files. Depend on version tags only.
  --proj-name                          Name of a project defined in the configuration file (for monorepos)
  --first-parent-only-commits          Ignore commits beyond the first parent

Commands:
  inspect                              Prints the current version to stdout
```

## Supported commit types

Every commit should be in the form
`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
for example
`fix(parser): remove colon from type and scope`

* fix - will trigger a patch version increment in the next release
* feat - will trigger a minor version increment in the next release
* all other types - you can use any commit type but that commit type will not trigger a version increment in the next release

Breaking changes **must** contain a line prefixed with `BREAKING CHANGE:` to allow versionize recognizing a breaking change. Breaking changes can use any commit type.

**Example**

```bash
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies" -m "BREAKING CHANGE: this will likely break the interface"
```

## The happy versioning walkthrough

### Preparation

Create a new project with the dotnet cli

```bash
mkdir SomeProject
dotnet new classlib
```

Ensure that a &lt;Version&gt; element is contained in file SomeProject.csproj

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <Version>1.0.0</Version>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

### Using versionize

Now let's start committing and releasing

```bash
git init
...make some changes to "Class1.cs"
git add *
git commit -a -m "chore: initial commit"

versionize
```

Will add a CHANGELOG.md, add git tags and commit everything. Note that the version in `SomeProject.csproj` will not change since this is your first release with `versionize`.

```bash
...make some changes to "Class1.cs"
git commit -a -m "fix: something went wrong we need a bugfix release"

versionize
```

Will update CHANGELOG.md, add git tags and commit everything. Note that the version in `SomeProject.csproj` is now `1.0.1`.

```bash
...make some changes to "Class1.cs"
git commit -a -m "feat: something really awesome coming in the next release"

versionize
```

Will update CHANGELOG.md, add git tags and commit everything. Note that the version in `SomeProject.csproj` is now `1.1.0`.

```bash
...make some changes to "Class1.cs"
git commit -a -m "feat: a really cool new feature" -m "BREAKING CHANGE: the API will break. sorry"

versionize
```

Will update CHANGELOG.md, add git tags and commit everything. Note that the version in `SomeProject.csproj` is now `2.0.0` since
versionize detected a breaking change since the commit note `BREAKING CHANGE` was used above.

### Pre-releases

Versionize supports creating pre-release versions by using the `--pre-release` flag with a pre-release label, for example `alpha`.

The following workflow illustrates how pre-release workflows with versionize work.

```shell
> git commit -a -m "chore: initial commit"
> versionize
// Generates version v1.0.0

> git commit -a -m "feat: some feature"
> versionize --pre-release alpha
// Generates version v1.1.0-alpha.0

> git commit -a -m "feat: some additional feature"
> versionize --pre-release alpha
// Generates version v1.1.0-alpha.1

> git commit -a -m "feat: some breaking feature" -m "BREAKING CHANGE: This is a breaking change"
> versionize --pre-release alpha
// Generates version v2.0.0-alpha.0

> versionize
// Generates version v2.0.0
```

### Aggregated pre-releases changelog

By default, each commit message only appears in the release it was introduced. When using the pre-release feature
this can result in a fragmented changelog. For example, when promoting to a full release the user has to browse
through all the pre-release sections to see what's included.

```
v1.0.0-alpha.0
- featA
v1.0.0-alpha.1
- featB
v1.0.0
```

So to get around that you can pass the `--aggregate-pre-releases` flag

```
versionize --pre-release alpha
versionize --pre-release alpha
versionize --aggregate-pre-releases
```

to get output like the following

```
v1.0.0-alpha.0
- featA
v1.0.0-alpha.1
- featB
v1.0.0
- featA
- featB
```

This also works together with the `pre-release` option

`versionize --pre-release alpha --aggregate-pre-releases`

### Skip pre-release tags

Some developers may prefer not to tag pre-releases. Here's an example of how to achieve that:

```
versionize --pre-release alpha --skip-tag
versionize --pre-release alpha --skip-tag --find-release-commit-via-message
...
```

`find-release-commit-via-message` is necessary because Versionize uses git tags by default to determine the current version. Without a git tag, the way we determine which commits get included in the changelog is by searching for the last commit message that starts with _"chore(release):"_. 

## Configuration

You can configure `versionize` either by creating a `.versionize` JSON file the working directory.

Any of the command line parameters accepted by `versionize` can be provided via configuration file leaving out any `-`. For example `skip-dirty` can be provided as `skipDirty` in the configuration file. 
The `.versionize` configuration file is deserialized into a `FileConfig.cs` object behind the scenes.

Changelog customization can only be done via a `.versionize` file. The following is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "changelog": {
    "header": "My Changelog",
    "includeAllCommits": true,
    "sections": [
      {
        "type": "feat",
        "section": "‚ú® Features",
        "hidden": false
      },
      {
        "type": "fix",
        "section": "üêõ Bug Fixes",
        "hidden": true
      },
      {
        "type": "perf",
        "section": "üöÄ Performance",
        "hidden": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Because `IncludeAllCommits` is true and the _fix_ section is hidden, fix commits will appear in the a section titled "Other".

## Roadmap

* [] Signed release commits
* [] Command to print out changelog entry since last release (as opposed to writing to a file)
* [] Tag prefix config (for non mono-repos)
* [] Add support for bumping a Unity project version
* [] Improve documentation
